# Kali Linux Docker Container with XFCE Desktop over VNC / noVNC

Did you ever want to start a fully-fledged Kali Linux Docker container with a full desktop experience? If so, then this Docker image suits your needs: it provides quick access to all Kali Linux tools via CLI and even a Kali Desktop of your choice – directly from within the Docker container. It uses `x11vnc` to provide a VNC connection to the container and `noVNC` for simple VNC access with your browser.

**IMPORTANT:** This image is for testing purposes only. Do not run it on any production systems or for any productive purposes. Feel free to modify it as you like – build instructions are given below.
